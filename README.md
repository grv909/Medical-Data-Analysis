# Medical Dataset Analysis: Python, SQL, and Insights

Welcome to the "Medical Dataset Analysis" project! This project delves into the world of healthcare data, combining the power of Python and SQL to extract valuable insights from interconnected medical datasets.

## Overview

- Explore the potential hidden in three critical datasets: "hospitalization_details," "medical_examinations," and "names."
- Two modules: Data Cleaning and SQL Analysis.
- Uncover insights for healthcare decision-making and resource optimization.

## Modules

### Module 1: Data Cleaning

1. **Loading Hospitalization Details**
   - Load data from 'hospitalisation_details.csv' into Pandas DataFrame 'hosp_details.'

2. **Identifying Null Values in Hospitalization Details**
   - Count and handle null values for data accuracy.

3. **Identifying Data Types in Hospitalization Details**
   - Determine data types for effective analysis.

4. **Identifying Duplicate Data in Hospitalization Details**
   - Quantify and handle duplicate data for data quality.

5. **Data Preprocessing and Cleaning for Hospitalization Details**
   - Remove duplicates, irrelevant columns, and save the cleaned dataset.

6. **Loading Medical Examination Data**
   - Load 'medical_examinations.csv' into Pandas DataFrame 'med_exam.'

7. **Identifying Null Values in Medical Examination Data**
   - Count and handle null values for data accuracy.

8. **Identifying Data Types in Medical Examination Data**
   - Determine data types for effective analysis.

9. **Identifying Duplicate Data in Medical Examination Data**
   - Quantify and handle duplicate data for data quality.

10. **Data Preprocessing and Cleaning for Medical Examination Data**
    - Remove duplicates, irrelevant columns, and save the cleaned dataset.

### Module 2: SQL Analysis

11. **Data Download, Import, and Database Connection**
    - Download external data, import, and establish a database connection.

12. **Average Hospital Charges Analysis**
    - Analyze medical dataset to determine average hospital charges.

13. **High Charges Analysis**
    - Identify unique customer identifiers, years, and charges for records with charges exceeding 700.

14. **High BMI Patients Analysis**
    - Retrieve name, year, and charges for customers with BMI greater than 35.

15. **Customers with Major Surgeries Analysis**
    - List customer IDs and names of individuals who have undergone major surgeries.

16. **Average Charges by Hospital Tier in 2000**
    - Calculate average hospital charges per tier in the year 2000.

17. **Smoking Patients with Transplants Analysis**
    - Retrieve customer IDs, BMI, and charges for smoking patients with transplants.

18. **Patients with Major Surgeries or Cancer History**
    - Retrieve names of customers with at least two major surgeries or a history of cancer.

19. **Customer with Most Major Surgeries**
    - Identify and display the customer with the highest number of major surgeries.

20. **Customers with Major Surgeries and City Tiers**
    - Compile a list of customers with major surgeries and their respective city tiers.

21. **Average BMI by City Tier in 1995**
    - Calculate average BMI for each city tier level in 1995.

22. **High BMI Customers with Health Issues**
    - Extract customer IDs, names, and charges for customers with BMI greater than 30 and health issues.

23. **Customers with Highest Charges and City Tier by Year**
    - Identify the customer with the highest total charges for each year and display their city tier.

24. **Top 3 Customers with Highest Average Yearly Charges**
    - Identify the top 3 customers with the highest average yearly charges.

25. **Ranking Customers by Total Charges**
    - Rank customers based on their total charges over the years.

26. **Identifying Peak Year for Hospitalizations**
    - Identify the year with the highest number of hospitalizations.
